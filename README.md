# What

A small web game about typing in the required keys before the timer runs out.

# Why

I love these kinds of games.

I needed a small project, partly to exercise creativity and partly to cope with depression.

# Disclaimers

The game is **not** optimized for anything other than desktop displays.

It is also **not** optimized for virtual keyboards, even if you have a display large enough to display the game correctly. It's theoretically possible, but it may end up being an exercise in self-flaggelation.

# How to Play

[Open the game](https://firebrandcoding.github.io/password). The countdown starts as soon as you open the page.

Press the keys you see on the screen.

If you press all of them in time, you advance to the next round. If you don't, the game is over. Press `[Space]` to start over when that happens.

There's no score. Play and start over for as long as you like. Quit when you've had enough.
